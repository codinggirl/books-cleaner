# book-cleaner

A tool to clean up the book library directory on computer.

## What's This

Celibre is not a good tool sometimes, it generated many directories, and put a lot of files into it.

But for Chinese books, it translate book names, ie, directory names, into Chinese Pinyin, that Chinese never used to mark their books.

The Pinyin Mark Method is a hard to read way.

So, if I did need re-classify the books, I need a small tool.

This tool put txt, pdf, epub, mobi, awz, awz3 files into each of its own direcotries.

Oh, so appetizing!

## How to use

First, clone the repo, and modify it to fit your needs.

At this time, you should install the dependecies.

```
npm install
```

And edit the config file.

Then, just run it!

```
npm start
```

Tada! That's all.
